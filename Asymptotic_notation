Big O notation is a powerful tool used in computer science to describe the time complexity or space complexity of algorithms. It provides a standardized way to compare the efficiency of different algorithms in terms of their worst-case performance. Understanding Big O notation is essential for analyzing and designing efficient algorithms.

2. Big Omega notation (Ω) : 

It is define as lower bound and lower bound on an algorithm is the least amount of time required ( the most efficient way possible, in other words best case).
Just like Onotation provide an asymptotic upper bound, Ωnotation provides asymptotic lower bound. 

3. Big Theta notation (Θ) : 

It is define as tightest bound and tightest bound is the best of all the worst case times that the algorithm can take.
